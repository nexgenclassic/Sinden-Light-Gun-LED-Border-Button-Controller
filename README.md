# Sinden-Light-Gun-LED-Border-Button-Controller

This was developed for a custom arcade machine featuring sinden light guns. 

It is dual purpose code for the  Arduino Micro. It controls two individually addressable LED strips (one for a light border to surround the screen, the other for cabinet lighting). 
It is controllable via serial interface through USB connection (compatible with autohotkey/eventghost). 
Additionally it provides keyboard functionality for arcade cabinet buttons across the remaining free DIO pins.

This is a template shared as a basis for individuals to modify, the code is dirty in places, but functional. Please make pull requests if you improve the code and i'll endeavour to review and update.
